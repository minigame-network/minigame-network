# minigame-network
3+ Years in Development Minigame Network Project for Spigot.

Welcome to the main repo for the Minigame Network! This is the main repo you should clone and work on.
It is built up of submodules, which are each module that builds up the project.

This project was developed by Scott Hiett (Sodex234) and Chase Henderson (chasertw123), spanning from 2016 to present. This code was used on servers with various names, so a lot of you may have played these games at some point.

If you have any questions, feel free to send Scott an email at "scott@hiett.digital", or to Chase at "henderson.chase@gmail.com".

This code is licenced under MIT. That means that if you ever use it, you have to include the LICENCE notice, and we request that you also include this file.

## Installation / Build instructions to come.
